                <p>Geographical Origin: Originated in France, following the Impressionist movement.</p>
                <p>Historical Context: Post-Impressionism developed as a reaction to the limitations of Impressionism.

                <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
                <p>Main Features: A focus on structure, form, and symbolic content, often with more defined shapes and lines than Impressionism. Post-Impressionists used bold colors, expressive brushstrokes, and experimented with new techniques.</p>
                <p>Philosophy & Ideals: Post-Impressionism sought to convey deeper meanings and emotions in art, moving beyond the transient effects of light and color to explore the artist's inner world and the symbolic potential of color and form.</p>
                <p>Innovations: Introduction of pointillism, expressive use of color, and a move towards abstraction.</p>
