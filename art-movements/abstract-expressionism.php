                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>Time Period: Mid-20th century (1940s-1950s).</p>
                <p>Geographical Origin: Originated in the United States, particularly New York City.</p>
                <p>Historical Context: Abstract Expressionism emerged in the aftermath of World War II, as artists sought new ways to express emotion and explore abstraction. The movement marked a shift in the art world’s focus from Europe to the United States.</p>
                
                <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
                <p>Main Features: Large-scale, abstract works that emphasize spontaneity, emotion, and the physical act of painting. Abstract Expressionism is often divided into two approaches: Action Painting (emphasizing gesture and movement) and Color Field Painting (focusing on large areas of color and subtle variations in tone).</p>
                <p>Philosophy & Ideals: The movement emphasized individual expression and the exploration of the unconscious. Artists sought to convey emotion and inner experience through abstraction, often rejecting traditional forms and techniques.</p>
                <p>Innovations: The use of unconventional materials and techniques, such as dripping and pouring paint, as well as the emphasis on the physicality of the creative process. Abstract Expressionism also marked a shift towards larger canvases and bolder, more dramatic compositions.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Artists:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jackson Pollock: Known for his drip paintings, which epitomize the spontaneity and energy of Action Painting.</li>
                    <li>Mark Rothko: A pioneer of Color Field Painting, known for his large, luminous canvases that evoke deep emotional responses.</li>
                    <li>Willem de Kooning: Celebrated for his dynamic, gestural paintings that combine abstraction and figuration.</li>
                </ul>

                    <div class="example">
                        <img src="../media/artworks/no-5-1948.jpg" alt="No. 5, 1948" class="artwork-image">
                        <h4>Artwork Title: No. 5, 1948</h4>

                        <p>Year: 1948</p>
                        <p>Description: This iconic drip painting exemplifies Pollock’s innovative technique, in which paint is poured and splattered onto the canvas. The work’s chaotic, energetic composition reflects the movement’s emphasis on spontaneity and emotion.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <img src="../media/artworks/orange-and-yellow.jpg" alt="Orange and Yellow" class="artwork-image">
                        <h4>Artwork Title: Orange and Yellow</h4>

                        <p>Year: 1956</p>
                        <p>Description: Rothko’s large, luminous canvases feature blocks of color that seem to float and merge, evoking deep emotional responses. This work reflects the meditative quality of Color Field Painting and the movement’s focus on inner experience.</p>

                <h3>Cultural Impact:</h3>
                <p>Reception: Abstract Expressionism was celebrated for its bold innovation and emotional intensity, but it also faced criticism for its perceived elitism and abstraction. Nonetheless, it became one of the most influential movements of the 20th century.</p>
                <p>Societal Influence: The movement marked a shift in the art world’s focus to the United States and contributed to the broader cultural embrace of abstraction and individual expression.</p>
                <p>Legacy: Abstract Expressionism’s impact can be seen in later movements, such as Minimalism and Conceptual Art, as well as in contemporary practices that emphasize process and emotion.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>Summary: Abstract Expressionism revolutionized modern art by emphasizing individual expression and abstraction, leaving a lasting impact on the art world and establishing the United States as a center of artistic innovation.</p>
