                <p>Time Period: Early 20th century.</p>
                <p>Geographical Origin: Originated in Germany and Austria.</p>
                <p>Historical Context: Expressionism emerged as a reaction against the materialism and urbanization of the early 20th century. It sought to express the emotional and psychological experience of the individual, often in response to the anxieties of modern life.</p>
                
                <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
                <p>Main Features: Use of bold, distorted forms, intense colors, and exaggerated lines to convey emotion. Expressionist art often depicted inner turmoil, alienation, and the darker aspects of human experience.</p>
                <p>Philosophy & Ideals: Expressionism emphasized the subjective experience of the artist, focusing on emotional and psychological content rather than realistic representation. The movement sought to reveal the inner world of the individual through distorted and symbolic imagery.</p>
                <p>Innovations: The use of distortion, abstraction, and symbolism to convey emotion and psychological depth.</p>
