                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made from pigment suspended in an acrylic polymer emulsion. It is versatile and can be used on various surfaces, including canvas, paper, and wood. Acrylics are known for their vibrant colors and ability to mimic other mediums like watercolor or oil paint.</p>
                
                <h3>History:</h3>
                <p>Acrylic paint was developed in the mid-20th century and became popular among artists in the 1950s. Its synthetic nature and quick drying time offered new possibilities for artists, influencing movements such as Abstract Expressionism.</p>

                    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Can be used on a variety of surfaces and thinned with water or mixed with other media.</li>
                    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Once dry, acrylics are water-resistant and less prone to cracking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color Retention:</strong> Acrylic paints retain their color and vibrancy over time.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Impasto:</strong> Using thick layers of paint to create texture and dimension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dry Brushing:</strong> Using a dry brush to apply paint for a textured effect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pouring:</strong> Pouring thinned acrylic paint onto a surface to create fluid and abstract effects.</li>
